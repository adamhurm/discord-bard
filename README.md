# Discord Bard - Container Factory
I use this repo to build discord music bot containers.

When the [JMusicBot](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot) project has a new release, I merge it and use [this workflow](https://github.com/adamhurm/discord-bard/actions/workflows/make-release.yml) to create a docker build.
